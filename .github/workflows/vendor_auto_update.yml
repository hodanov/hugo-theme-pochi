          body: |
            This PR was created automatically to upgrade vendored search libraries to their latest versions and sync them into `assets/js/vendor/` via Hugo Pipes.

            - Updated devDependencies (fuse.js, mark.js) using npm-check-updates
            - Synced vendored files and updated VENDOR.lock.json
            - Verified hashes with `npm run vendor:verify`

            Review notes:
            - Fuse.js may introduce behavior changes across major versions. Please verify search quality and performance.
